## Instructions

### Phase 1: Extract Structured Evidence

Before writing anything, extract structured claims from the research findings. For each claim:
- State the factual claim in one sentence
- List which research sources support it
- Rate confidence: High (multiple authoritative sources), Medium (single source or non-authoritative), Low (inferred or weakly supported)

Also identify:
- **Coverage gaps**: What does the ticket intent require that the research did NOT cover?
- **Contradictions**: Do any sources disagree? Note which position is better supported.

This extraction is your evidence base. The document you draft MUST be grounded in these claims.

### Phase 2: Draft the Document

1. **Explore existing structure**: Use Glob to discover the repository's folder structure and existing documents. Understand naming conventions and organizational patterns.

2. **Check for existing documents**: Use Grep to search for documents covering similar topics. If a related document exists, update it rather than creating a duplicate.

3. **Determine placement**: Place the document in the correct directory:
   - `governance/` — bylaws, board policies, organizational structure
   - `compliance/election-law/` — federal/state election law compliance
   - `compliance/state/` — state-specific regulations
   - `operations/` — operational procedures, workflows, SOPs
   - `training/` — training materials, onboarding guides, how-to documents
   - `research/` — research summaries, analysis reports

4. **Draft the document**: Write a complete, professional markdown document including:
   - Clear title as H1 heading
   - Metadata block (effective date, version, owner/department, review cycle)
   - Purpose/scope section
   - Main content organized with clear headings
   - Action items or implementation steps where applicable

5. **Evidence traceability**: At the end of the document, include an `## Evidence Traceability` appendix that maps key claims in the document back to research sources. Format:

   | Document Section | Claim | Source |
   |-----------------|-------|--------|
   | Section 3.1 | The prohibition is absolute with no de minimis exception | IRS.gov, Council of Nonprofits |

6. **Write the file**: Save the document to the appropriate directory using the Write tool.

## Critical Rule: No Silent Knowledge Injection

You MUST only use information present in the research findings above. If you need to include information that is NOT in the research findings — for example, a specific legal citation, a technical detail, or a fact you know from training data — you MUST mark it with `[AGENT KNOWLEDGE]` inline. Example:

> Organizations may file Form 5768 to elect the expenditure test [AGENT KNOWLEDGE]

This makes it visible when the document contains claims not grounded in the research pipeline. A human reviewer can then verify these independently.

If the research is insufficient to draft a complete document, write what you can and clearly note gaps that need further research. Do NOT silently fill gaps with your own knowledge.

## Output Format

After writing the document, provide a summary:
- **File path**: Where the document was saved
- **Document type**: Policy, procedure, checklist, training guide, etc.
- **Key sections**: Brief list of major sections created
- **Agent knowledge insertions**: List any claims marked with [AGENT KNOWLEDGE] and why they were needed
- **Coverage gaps**: What the research didn't cover that the document needs

## Constraints

- Write ONLY within this repository. Do not attempt to access other repos or external services.
- Follow existing naming conventions (kebab-case filenames, .md extension).
- Do not include implementation plans, code, or technical specifications — this is for organizational documents.
- Keep language clear, professional, and accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- Maximum one document per execution. If the ticket covers multiple documents, draft the primary one.
